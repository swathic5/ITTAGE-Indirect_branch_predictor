This directory contains the source code to the compression engine used to
pre-process the CBP-2 traces.  Before the CBP-2 traces were compressed with
bzip2, they were pre-processed with this code that uses prediction to remove
redundancy from the traces.  For instance, without this pre-processing,
the un-bzip2'ed version of the 164.gzip trace is 164 MB, compared with 18
MB after applying this pre-processing step.

In this directory, the program 'ct' (for 'C'ompress 'T'races) reads a gzip
or bzip2 compressed file named on the command line and either applies
the pre-processing (with the '-c' option) or reverses it to produce the
original file (with the '-d' option).  To recover the original uncompressed
trace for a CBP-2 trace, say 164.gzip, you would type this:

ct -d gzip.trace.bz2 > gzip.trace

The format of the original traces is documented in the trace.cc file
in the src/ directory.  That file is derived from the trace.cc in this
directory which is less documented but contains more features e.g. the
compression engine.  To pre-process and compress a file that has been put
into this original un-pre-processed format, you would type this:

ct -c foo.trace | gzip > foo.trace.gz

This step will print annoying output giving statistics about the quality
of the compression in the pre-processing step.
